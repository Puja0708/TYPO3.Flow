 * the bootstrap's getActiveRequestHandler() method, it also needs some support
 * for HTTP request testing scenarios. For that reason it features a setRequest()
 * method which is used by the FunctionalTestCase for setting the current HTTP
 * request. That way, the request handler acts pretty much like the Http\RequestHandler
 * from a client code perspective.
 *
 * The virtual browser's InternalRequestEngine will also set the current request
 * via the setRequest() method.
