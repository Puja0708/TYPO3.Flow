Upgrading instructions
======================

This file contains instructions for upgrading your FLOW3 1.1 based
applications to TYPO3 Flow 2.0.

If you have been using FLOW3 so far, chances are high you will want to
follow up on TYPO3 Flow for all the new goodies it provides. But how
hard is an upgrade of existing code? And what about your git
repositories?

Upgrading the code in your packages is described first, see `Upgrading
your Packages`_.

The integration of Composer for dependency management changes how
packages are "assembled" into a distribution and a manifest file
replaces the use of git submodules in our distributions. For most
people, some cleanup in their git repositories will thus be needed.
This is described in the section `Upgrading your Git repositories`_

For starters, here are some other changes you need to be aware of.

What has changed
----------------

Namespaces and class locations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most obvious change is the renaming of FLOW3 to TYPO3 Flow. Since
the product name is reflected in the PHP namespace of classes, all code
using FLOW3 needs to be adjusted and ``FLOW3`` must be replaced by
``TYPO3\Flow``.

The integration of composer for dependency management requires all code
to follow the `PSR-0 rules
<https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md>`_
for class autoloading - something FLOW3 did not do fully. So the vendor
and package name parts of the PHP namespaces need to be reflected in
the Classes folder structure of a package.

MVC changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

**Custom Error Renderers** are now available, the exception handlers
can render arbitrary templates based on the status code and/or class
name of the thrown exception. This is considered a breaking change
because it deprecates the provided NotFoundController & NotFoundView.

----

``Http\\Uri`` constructor **now expects a valid URI** and throws an
exception if the given Uri is considered seriously malformed. This is
considered breaking because prior to this change, the Uri just silently
was created with all empty values.

-----

The way to **define the supported formats of a controller** has
changed: Previously a class property ``$supportedFormats`` contained a
list of filename extensions which would be supported. This property is
not supported anymore. Instead, controllers may now specify a list of
IANA Internet Media Types in a property ``$supportedMediaTypes``.

The default setting for these supported media types in ActionController
is "text/html". You'll need to adjust your controllers accordingly if
you relied on the $supportedFormats feature.

Also note that the format in ActionRequest is now NULL by default. The
ActionController makes sure to set the correct format, but if you
created your own ActionRequest for a special purpose, you need to take
care of setting it yourself.

----

The term MIME type is outdated, at least if used in a web context. The
correct term is "Internet Media Type". Furthermore, our list of MIME
types (or media types) was not up to date.

This patch introduces a new utility class ``MediaTypes`` which replaces
``FileTypes``. This is a breaking change as **the FileTypes class is
deprecated** with it. The old methods are still available but should not
be used anymore. A code migration to use the new ones instead is
shipped with the change.

Validation changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now **validators must declare any options they accept** using the class
property ``$supportedOptions``. It is indexed by option name and holds
an array for each option giving the default value, a description, type
and an optional required flag.

This is used to check accepted options and to generate option
documentation for the validator reference documentation.

----

Empty strings are now correctly converted as NULL values in the Float
and Integer converters. This is a breaking change if you relied upon
the old behavior that empty values are converted to the number 0.

Session changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PhpSession implementation was removed and the new Flow-native
implementation is the default session handler now.

If you provided specific configuration for session cookies through
TYPO3:FLOW3:Session:PHPSession:* (or TYPO3:FLOW3:Session:PhpSession:*),
you will need to adjust your settings to use options in
TYPO3:Flow:Session:* instead.

Persistence changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We added little a change to your database schema -
``flow3_persistence_identifier`` has become
``persistence_object_identifier`` during the renaming of FLOW3 to Flow.
See `Upgrading the database schema`_ for more information.

----

Until now ``QueryResult::count()`` ignored limit constraints that
were active for the affected query, so
``$query->setLimit(3)->execute()->count()`` could return a value > 3.
If the query had an offset Flow even threw an exception.

This has been fixed, so that **limit and offset constraints are taken
into account by QueryResult::count()** now.

This is a breaking change if you relied on Query::count() to always
return *all* results regardless of a specified limit. In this case
better generate multiple QueryResults (they're only created in-memory
until you actually access them).

----

**Join columns** are now created and used in the same way, whether you have
a ``JoinTable`` annotation in your model or not. This is (almost) a
cosmetic fix as it works without, but can lead to confusion if looking
at the database. If you annotated with ``JoinTable``, this could be a
breaking change, as the join columns might change.

----

Flow does no longer have it's own default for **orphanRemoval** on
many-to-many associations. That means if you want ``orphanRemoval`` on
many-to-many associations, you now must explicitly enable it with the
annotation option (in Doctrine 2 ORM orphan removal is disabled by
default, as well).

----

The **RepositoryInterface** now includes ``__call()`` to satisfy
developer expectations for methods like ``findOneBy…`` methods. This is
only breaking if your repositories do not extend the provided base
repositories.

----

When using Doctrine for persistence, the magic ``__call()`` method now
returns a ``QueryResultInterface`` instance (as it should). This is a
breaking change if you relied on the specific return values before, in
this you need to adjust your code.

Other Flow changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The method ``getPackageNamespace()`` was renamed to ``getNamespace()``.

----

The ``DataNotSerializeableException`` was renamed to
``DataNotSerializableException``.

----

TYPO3 Flow **no longer magically sets a default timezone** if there's
none set, because every default time zone will be the wrong one for
most people. This change is marked breaking because in cases where no
timezone is set in PHP configuration, Flow will no longer work.

Fluid changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **uri.resource viewhelper** no longer has the ``uri`` attribute.
The ``path`` attribute must be used instead, and now accepts
``resource://…`` URIs as well.

----

Fluid now **only parses arrays inside ViewHelper arguments**, such that
an array inside normal text is not converted anymore.

This change is only breaking in very rare cases where one relied on
the inner contents of the ViewHelper being an array, f.e. if one used
the debug ViewHelper as follows::

	<f:debug>{key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'}</f:debug>

… or if anybody wrote custom ViewHelpers which use this convention.

Relying on that would be very fragile anyways, as the insertion of a
single space character before the opening curly bracket or after the
closing one would cast the array back to a string.

ViewHelpers which were written like this should be re-written to take
the array as ViewHelper argument::

	<f:debug value="{key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'}" />


Upgrading your Packages
-----------------------

Upgrading existing code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here comes the easier part. As with earlier changes to TYPO3 Flow that
required code changes on the user side we provide a code migration tool.
Given you have a TYPO3 Flow system with your (outdated) package in place
you should run the following before attempting to fix anything by hand::

 ./flow core:migrate --package-key Acme.Demo

The package key is optional, if left out it will work on all packages
it finds - for the first run you might want to limit things a little to
keep the overview, though.

Inside core:migrate
"""""""""""""""""""

The tool roughly works like this:

* Collect all code migrations from packages

* Collect all files from all packages (except *Framework* and
  *Libraries*) or the package given with ``--package-key``
* For each migration and package

  * Check for clean git working copy (otherwise skip it)
  * Check if migration is needed (looks for Migration footers in commit
    messages)
  * Apply migration and commit the changes

Afterwards you probably get a list of warnings and notes from the
migrations, check those to see if anything needs to be done manually.

Check the created commits and feel free to amend as needed, should
things be missing or wrong. The only thing you must keep in place from
the generated commit messages is the Migration: … footer. It is used to
detect if a migration has been applied already, so if you drop it,
things might get out of hands in the future.

Upgrading the database schema
-----------------------------

Upgrading the schema is the harder part this time. You will probably
start by running::

 ./flow doctrine:migrate

to update your database with any changes to the framework-supplied
schema. Then run::

 ./flow doctrine:migrationgenerate

`as usual <http://flow.typo3.org/documentation/guide/partiii/persistence.html#creating-migrations>`_
to create a migration based on the current state of database and code.
This time things are a bit special, since the primary key of a lot of
tables will change due to the renaming of the
``FLOW3_Persistence_Identifier`` property.

The hard part are the foreign key constraints that need to be updated
with this. The migration generated by Doctrine will contain commands to
rename that column for your package's models (tables) but will not
handle any foreign keys from other packages that might point to them.
We have a solution though.

When adjusting your generated migration (as usual you need to check it
anyway), just follow the following recipe:

* Order SQL statements to (the file `might look similar to this
  <https://review.typo3.org/gitweb?p=FLOW3/Packages/TYPO3.FLOW3.git;a=blob;f=Migrations/Mysql/Version20120930203452.php;h=38c56314bd3e197fa41982976a7e7a335d59cc5d;hb=a43c62ad7825fd235b6580c460418d53f9d2af63>`_
  afterwards)

  * dropping foreign key constraints
  * renaming fields
  * adding foreign key constraints

* Remove any SQL statements dealing with foreign key constraints
* Before the remaining statements adjusting your package's primary key columns add::

		// collect foreign keys pointing to "our" tables
	$tableNames = array(
		'acme_demo_foo', // change this!
		'acme_demo_bar', // change this!
	);
	$foreignKeyHandlingSql = \TYPO3\Flow\Persistence\Doctrine\Service::getForeignKeyHandlingSql(
		$schema, $this->platform, $tableNames,   'flow3_persistence_identifier', 'persistence_object_identifier'
	);

		// drop FK constraints
	foreach ($foreignKeyHandlingSql['drop'] as $sql) {
		$this->addSql($sql);
	}

* After the remaining statements add::

		// add back FK constraints
	foreach ($foreignKeyHandlingSql['add'] as $sql) {
		$this->addSql($sql);
	}

In the code to add, you have to adjust the list of affected tables - it
needs to list all tables in your package that have a
``flow3_persistence_identifier`` column. The file should now look
roughly `similar to this one
<https://review.typo3.org/gitweb?p=FLOW3/Packages/TYPO3.FLOW3.git;a=blob;f=Migrations/Mysql/Version20120930203452.php;h=3cc85935180c21437cda2532f5b671707df8dc13;hb=57526b7fa57d82b08b64144214df9ffb1e475ffe>`_.

Afterwards make sure to try your migration in up and down direction as
usual before using it in production!

Famous last words
-----------------

In a nutshell, running::

 ./flow core:migrate
 ./flow doctrine:migrationgenerate

padded with some manual checking and adjustments needs to be done. That
should result in a working package.

If it does not and you have no idea what to do next, please come over
to `#typo3-flow <irc://freenode.net/#typo3-flow>`_ on freenode IRC or
ask in the mailing list (news group) as you prefer. The `support page
<http://flow.typo3.org/support.html>`_ provides more information.

Upgrading your Git repositories
-------------------------------

One (very simple) way to use TYPO3 Flow with your own packages would be
to clone a fresh distribution and copy our packages over from your old
working copy. Then follow the instructions on `Upgrading your Packages`_

If you are keeping your own distribution under version control, things
are a bit more involved. If you know git, a look at `this commit might
contain all information you need
<http://git.typo3.org/FLOW3/Distributions/Base.git/commit/3922aeaeadae68cb04e30722d5e6cf01b00b6382>`_.
If not, read on.

Remove submodules for ``Framework``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since dependencies are now managed by composer, the git submodule
pointers are no longer used. To remove them, we used these commands::

  git rm --cached Packages/Framework/TYPO3.FLOW3
  git rm --cached Packages/Framework/TYPO3.Fluid
  git rm --cached Packages/Framework/TYPO3.Party
  git rm --cached Packages/Framework/TYPO3.Kickstart
  git rm --cached Packages/Framework/TYPO3.Welcome

  git rm --cached Packages/Framework/Doctrine.Common
  git rm --cached Packages/Framework/Doctrine.DBAL
  git rm --cached Packages/Framework/Doctrine.ORM

  git rm --cached Packages/Framework/Symfony.Component.DomCrawler
  git rm --cached Packages/Framework/Symfony.Component.Yaml

If you are tracking our repositories, you can of course pull in those
(and the following) changes. Git will probably complain about not being
able to remove the files and they will show up as untracked afterwards.
Don't worry, just remove the actual files now::

  rm -rf Packages/Framework/TYPO3.FLOW3
  rm -rf Packages/Framework/TYPO3.Fluid
  rm -rf Packages/Framework/TYPO3.Party

  rm -rf Packages/Framework/Doctrine.Common
  rm -rf Packages/Framework/Doctrine.DBAL
  rm -rf Packages/Framework/Doctrine.ORM

  rm -rf Packages/Framework/Symfony.Component.DomCrawler
  rm -rf Packages/Framework/Symfony.Component.Yaml

Last edit your `.gitmodules` file and remove the unneeded defintions.

Remove further submodules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any other submodules that are pulled in via composer now, may be
removed as well::

  git rm --cached Build/Common
  rm -rf Build/Common

If you added anything else, you have the choice now: you can keep it
managed via git submodules, or use composer.

Even more things to remove
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some files that we had under version control in the FLOW3 distribution
but which should have been in the FLOW3 package instead can be removed
as well! Because now they are indeed part of the Flow package itself
and will be copied to the correct location during installation::

 git rm .gitignore
 git rm .gitmodules
 git rm Configuration/Development/Settings.yaml.example
 git rm Configuration/Production/Settings.yaml.example
 git rm Configuration/README
 git rm Configuration/Routes.yaml
 git rm Configuration/Settings.yaml.example
 git rm Configuration/Testing/Settings.yaml
 git rm Readme.txt
 git rm Upgrading.txt
 git rm Web/.htaccess
 git rm Web/index.php
 git rm flow3
 git rm flow3.bat

Add a composer manifest file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now you need a composer manifest, a simple json file. Again, you can
pull the `base version in from our git repositories
<http://git.typo3.org/FLOW3/Distributions/Base.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/composer.json>`_.

It looks like this::

 {
     "name": "typo3/flow-base-distribution",
     "description" : "TYPO3 Flow Base Distribution",
     "license": "LGPL-3.0+",
     "repositories": [
         {
             "type": "composer",
             "url": "http://ci.typo3.robertlemke.net/job/composer-packages/ws/repository/"
         }
     ],
     "config": {
         "vendor-dir": "Packages/Libraries",
         "bin-dir": "bin"
     },
     "require": {
         "typo3/flow": "dev-master",
         "typo3/welcome": "dev-master"
     },
     "require-dev": {
         "typo3/kickstart": "dev-master",
         "typo3/buildessentials": "dev-master",
         "mikey179/vfsstream": "1.1.*"
     },
     "minimum-stability": "dev",
     "scripts": {
         "post-update-cmd": "TYPO3\\Flow\\Composer\\InstallerScripts::postUpdateAndInstall",
         "post-install-cmd": "TYPO3\\Flow\\Composer\\InstallerScripts::postUpdateAndInstall"
     }
 }

This tells Composer to install FLOW3 and it's dependencies (Doctrine
and Symfony parts, TYPO3.Fluid, TYPO3.Party).

Anything else you need can be added freely, have a look at the
`composer documentation <http://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md>`_.

Install dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What is left is actually installing all the dependencies::

 composer install --dev

This will fetch and install all the packages and libraries defined in
the manifest (and in turn their dependencies, and in turn…).

If you want to update the packages installed through this later, run::

 composer update --dev
