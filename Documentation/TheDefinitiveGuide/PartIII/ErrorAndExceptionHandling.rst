Error and Exception Handling
============================

FLOW3 reports applications errors by throwing specific exceptions. Exceptions are
structured in a hierarchy which is based on base exception classes for each
component. By default, PHP catchable errors, warnings and notices are automatically
converted into exceptions in order to simplify the error handling.

In case an exception cannot be handled by the application, a central exception
handler takes over to display or log the error and shut down the application
gracefully.

Throwing Exceptions
-------------------

Applications should throw exceptions which are based on one of the exception classes
provided by FLOW3. Each exception should be identified by a unique error code which
is, by convention, the unix timestamp of the point in time when the developer
implemented the code throwing the exception::

	if ($somethingWentReallyWrong) {
		throw new SomethingWentWrongException('An exception message', 1347145643);
	}

Exceptions can contain an HTTP status code which is sent as a corresponding response
header. The status code is simply set by defining a property with the respective
value assigned::

	class SomethingWasNotFoundException extends \TYPO3\FLOW3\Exception {

		/**
   	 * @var integer
   	 */
   	protected $statusCode = 404;

	}

Exception Handlers
------------------

FLOW3 comes with two different exception handlers:

* the ``DebugExceptionHandler`` displays a big amount of background information,
  including a call stack, in order to simplify debugging of the exception cause.
  The output might contain sensitive data because method arguments are displayed
  in the backtrace.

* the ``ProductionExceptionHandler`` displays a neutral message stating that an
  error occurred. Apart from a reference code no information about the nature of
  the exception or any parameters is disclosed.

By default, the ``DebugExceptionHandler`` is used in Development context and the
``ProductionExceptionHandler`` is in charge in the Production context.

The exception handler to be used can be configured through an entry in Settings.yaml:

.. code-block:: yaml

	TYPO3:
	  FLOW3:
	    error:
	      exceptionHandler:
	        # Defines the global, last-resort exception handler.
	        # The specified class must implement \TYPO3\FLOW3\Error\ExceptionHandlerInterface
	        className: TYPO3\FLOW3\Error\ProductionExceptionHandler

Reference Code
--------------

In a production context, the exception handler should, for security reasons, not
reveal any information about the inner workings and data of the application. In
order to be able to track down the root of the problem, FLOW3 generates a unique
reference code when an exception is thrown. It is safe to display this reference
code to the user who can, in turn, contact the administrators of the application
to report the error. At the server side, detailed information about the exception
is stored in a file named after the reference code.

You will find report files for exceptions thrown in ``Data/Logs/Exceptions/``. In
some rare cases though, when FLOW3 is not even able to write the respective log
file, no details about the exception can be provided.

Error Handler
-------------

FLOW3 provides a central error handler which jumps in if a PHP error, warning or
notice occurs. Instead of displaying or logging the error right away, it is
transformed into an ``ErrorException``.

A configuration option in Settings.yaml allows for deciding which error levels
should be converted into exceptions. All other errors are silently ignored::

.. code-block:: yaml

	TYPO3:
	  FLOW3:
	    error:
	      errorHandler:
	        # Defines which errors should result in an exception thrown - all other error
	        # levels will be silently ignored. Only errors that can be handled in an
	        # user-defined error handler are affected, of course.
	        exceptionalErrors: [%E_USER_ERROR%, %E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR%]
