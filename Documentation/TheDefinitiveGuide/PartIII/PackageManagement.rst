Package Management
==================

.. sectionauthor:: Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>


FLOW3 is a package-based system. In fact, FLOW3 itself is just a package as well - but
obviously an important one. Packages act as a container for different matters: Most of
them contain PHP code which adds certain functionality, others only contain documentation
and yet other packages consist of templates, images or other resources. The
`TYPO3 project`_ will host a package repository which acts as a convenient hub for
interchanging FLOW3 based packages with other community members.

.. note::

	At the time of writing the package repository for FLOW3 is still in the planning phase.
	In order to publish packages, use `TYPO3 Forge <http://forge.typo3.org>`_ for now.

Package Locations
=================

Framework and Application Packages
----------------------------------

FLOW3 packages are located in a sub folder of the *Packages/* directory. A typical
application (such as TYPO3 for example) will use the core packages which are bundled with
FLOW3 and use additional packages which are specific to the application. The framework
packages are kept in a directory called *Framework* while the application specific
packages reside in the *Application* directory. This leads to the following
folder structure:

* *Configuration/*
	The global configuration folder
* *Data/*
	The various data folders, temporary as well as persistent
* *Packages/*
	* *Framework/*
		The Framework directory contains packages of the FLOW3 distribution (just examples):

		* *TYPO3.FLOW3/*
			The FLOW3 package
		* *TYPO3.Fluid/*
			The Fluid package (Template Engine)

	* *Application/*
		The Application directory contains your own / application specific packages:

		* *TYPO3.TYPO3/*
			For example the TYPO3 package
		* *Acme.Demo/*
			Or the demo package

The reason for separating packages into separate directories is that the core packages
in *Framework/* can reside in a different, shared location and be symlinked
from the application using it. In this case, just delete the *Framework* directory and replace it with
a symlink pointing to the *Packages/Framework/* directory of the FLOW3 distribution.

We recommend that you keep a version of the FLOW3 distribution in
*/var/lib/flow3/flow3-x.y.z/* and flag all its content read-only for the web server's
user. By doing that you can assure that no FLOW3 package (or other PHP script) can tamper
with the  FLOW3 package and its built-in security framework.

Additional Package Locations
----------------------------

Apart from the *Application* and *Framework* package directories you may define your very own
additional package locations by just creating another directory or symlink in the
application's *Packages* directory. One example for this is the TYPO3 distribution, which
expects packages with website resources in a folder named *Sites*.

Loading Order
-------------

The loading order of packages locations is undefined, except that FLOW3 itself will of
course always be loaded first.


Package Directory Layout
========================

The FLOW3 package directory structure follows a certain convention which has the advantage
that you don't need to care about any package-related configuration. If you put your files
into the right directories, everything will just work.

The suggested directory layout of a FLOW3 package is as follows:

* *<[PackageName]>*

	* *Classes*
		This directory contains the actual source code for the package. Package authors
		are free to add (only!) class or interface files directly to this directory or add
		subdirectories to organize the content as necessary. All classes or interfaces
		below this directory are handled by the autoloading mechanism and will be
		registered at the object manager automatically (and will thus be considered
		"registered objects").

		One special file in here is the *Package.php* which contains the class with the
		package's bootstrap code.
	* *Configuration*
		All kinds of configuration which are delivered with the package reside in this
		directory. The configuration files are immutable and must not be changed by the
		user or administrator. The most prominent configuration files are the
		*Objects.yaml* file which may be used to configure the package's objects and
		the *Settings.yaml* file which contains general user-level settings.
	* *Documentation*
		Holds the package documentation. Please refer to the Documentor's Guide for
		more details about the directories and files within this directory.
	* *Meta*
		A folder which provides some meta information about the package.

		* *Package.xml*
			This mandatory file contains some basic information about the package, such as
			title, description, author, constraints, version number and more. You should take
			great care to keep this information updated.

	* *Resources*
		Contains static resources the package needs, such as library code, template files,
		graphics, ... In general, there is a distinction between public and private
		resources.

		* *Private*
			Contains private resources for the package. All files inside this directory
			will never be directly available from the web.
		* *Public*
			Contains public resources for the package. All files in this directory
			will be mirrored into FLOW3's *Web* directory by the Resource Manager
			(and therefore become accessible from the web).

		Although it is up to the package author to name the directories, we suggest the
		following conventions for directories below ``Private`` and ``Public``:

		.. warning:: The following folder structure is not yet finalized, it is more a rough draft.

		.. TODO: fix the above warning and then remove it.

		* *Media*
			This directory holds images, PDF, Flash, CSS and other files that will be
			delivered to the client directly without further processing.
		* *Templates*
			Template files used by the package should go here. If a user wants to modify
			the template it will end up elsewhere and should be pointed to by some
			configuration setting.
		* *PHP*
			Should hold any PHP code that is an external library which should not be
			handled by the object manager (at least not by default), is of procedural
			nature or doesn't belong into the classes directory for any other reason.
		* *Java*
			Should hold any Java code needed by the package. Repeat and rinse for
			Smalltalk, Modula, Pascal, ;)

		More directories can be added as needed.

	* *Tests*

		* *Unit*
			Holds the unit tests for the package.
		* *Functional*
			Holds the functional tests for the package.

As already mentioned, all classes which are found in the *Classes* directory will be
detected and registered. However, this only works if you follow the naming rules equally
for the class name as well as the file name. An example for a valid class name is
``\MyCompany\MyPackage\Controller\StandardController`` while the file containing this
class would be named *StandardController.php* and is expected to be in a directory
*MyPackage/Classes/Controller*.

All details about naming files, classes, methods and variables correctly can be found in
the FLOW3 Coding Guidelines. You're highly encouraged to read (and follow) them.

Package Keys
============

Package keys are used to uniquely identify packages and provide them with a namespace for
different purposes. They save you from conflicts between packages which were provided by
different parties.

We use *vendor namespaces* for package keys, i.e. all packages which are released
and maintained by the TYPO3 and FLOW3 core teams start with ``TYPO3.*``. In your company
we suggest that you use your company name as vendor namespace.

Importing and Installing Packages
=================================

At this time the features for import and installation of packages have not been
implemented fully. The current behavior is that all directories which are found below the
*Packages* folder are assumed to be packages. Just make sure that you created a
*Package.xml* file in the *Meta* directory of your package and a *Package.php* file
in the *Classes* directory.

If no *PackageStates.php* exists in your *Configuration* folder, it will be created
and all found packages will be activated. If *PackageStates.php* exists, you can use the
package manager to activate and deactivate packages through the FLOW3 command line script.

.. tip:: It is very convenient for continuous integration and deployment scenarios that
	all found packages on the first hit will be automatically registered.

The FLOW3 command line interface is triggered through the *flow3* script
in the main directory of the FLOW3 distribution. From a Unix
shell you should be able to run the script by entering ``./flow3`` (on windows,
use ``flow3.bat``).

To activate a package, use the ``package:activate`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ ./flow3 package:activate <PackageKey>

To deactivate a package, use ``package:deactivate``. For a listing of all packages
(active and inactive) use ``package:list``.

Package Manager
===============

The Package Manager is in charge of downloading, installing, configuring and activating
packages and registers their objects and resources.

.. note::

	In its current form, the package manager only provides the basic functionality which
	is necessary to use packages and their objects. More advanced features like installing
	or configuring packages are of course planned.

Creating a New Package
======================

Use the ``package:create`` command to create a new package:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ ./flow3 package:create Acme.Demo

This will create the package in *Packages/Application*. After that, adjust *Meta/Package.xml*
to your needs. Apart from that no further steps are necessary.

Package Meta Information
========================

All packages need to provide some meta information to FLOW3. The data is split in two
files, depending on primary use.

Classes/Package.php
-------------------

This file contains bootstrap code for the package. It must exist, but may contain only an
empty class, if no bootstrap code is needed.

*Example: Minimal Package.php* ::

	namespace Acme\Demo;

	use TYPO3\FLOW3\Package\Package as BasePackage;

	/**
	 * The Acme.Demo Package
	 *
	 */
	class Package extends BasePackage {
	}

Meta/Package.xml
----------------

This file contains some meta information for the package manager. The format of this file
follows a RelaxNG schema which is available at
`http://typo3.org/ns/2008/flow3/package/Package.rng`_.

Here is an example of a valid *Package.xml* file:

*Example: Package.xml*

.. code-block:: xml

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes" ?>
	<package xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
