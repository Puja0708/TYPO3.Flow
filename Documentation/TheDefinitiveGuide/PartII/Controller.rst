Controller

Now that we have the first models and repositories in place we can almost move forward to
creating our first controller.

Setup Controller
================

The ``SetupController`` will be in charge of creating a ``Blog`` object, setting a title
and description and storing it in the ``BlogRepository``. The kickstarter created a very
basic setup controller containing only one action, the ``indexAction``. Let's create and
store a new blog once the index action is called::

	<?php
	namespace TYPO3\Blog\Controller;

	use TYPO3\FLOW3\Annotations as FLOW3;

	// ...

	class SetupController extends \TYPO3\FLOW3\MVC\Controller\ActionController {

		/**
		 * @FLOW3\Inject
		 * @var \TYPO3\Blog\Domain\Repository\BlogRepository
		 */
		protected $blogRepository;

		/**
		 * @FLOW3\Inject
		 * @var \TYPO3\Blog\Domain\Repository\PostRepository
		 */
		protected $postRepository;

		/**
		 * Sets up a fresh blog and creates a sample post.
		 *
		 * @return void
		 */
		public function indexAction() {
			$this->blogRepository->removeAll();
			$this->postRepository->removeAll();

			$blog = new \TYPO3\Blog\Domain\Model\Blog();
			$blog->setTitle('My Blog');
			$blog->setDescription('A blog about Foo, Bar and Baz.');
			$this->blogRepository->add($blog);

			$post = new \TYPO3\Blog\Domain\Model\Post();
			$post->setAuthor('John Doe');
			$post->setTitle('Example Post');
			$post->setContent('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.');
			$this->postRepository->add($post);

			$blog->addPost($post);

			return 'Successfully created a blog';
		}
	}

	?>

You can probably figure out easily what the ``indexAction`` does – it empties the
``BlogRepository`` and ``PostRepository``, creates a new ``Blog`` object and adds it to
the ``BlogRepository``. In addition a sample blog post is created and added to the
``PostRepository`` and blog. Note that if you had omitted the lines::

	$this->blogRepository->add($blog);

and ::

	$this->postRepository->add($post);

the blog and the post would have been created in memory but not persisted to
the database.

Using the blog and post repository sounds plausible, but where do you get the
repositories from?

::

	/**
	 * @FLOW3\Inject
	 * @var \TYPO3\Blog\Domain\Repository\BlogRepository
	 */
	protected $blogRepository;

The property declarations for ``$blogRepository`` (and ``$postRepository``) is marked with
an ``Inject`` annotation. This signals to the object framework: I need the blog
repository here, please make sure it's stored in this member variable. In effect FLOW3
will inject the blog repository into the ``$blogRepository`` property right after your
controller has been instantiated. And because the blog repository's scope is *singleton*
[#]_, the framework will always inject the same instance of the repository.

There's a lot more to discover about **Dependency Injection** and we recommend
that you read the whole chapter about objects in the
`FLOW3 guide <http://flow3.typo3.org/documentation/guide>`_ once you start with
your own coding.

To create the required database tables we now use the command line support to generate the
tables for our package:

.. code-block:: none

	myhost:tutorial johndoe$ ./flow3 doctrine:update

Try out the ``SetupController`` by accessing
http://dev.tutorial.local/typo3.blog/setup/index. If all went right you should see the
*Successfully created a blog* message on your screen. In order to find this blog again, we
add a method ``findActive`` to the ``BlogRepository``::

	/**
	 * Finds the active blog.
	 *
	 * As of now only one Blog is supported anyway so we just assume that only one
	 * Blog object resides in the Blog Repository.
	 *
	 * @return \TYPO3\Blog\Domain\Model\Blog The active blog or FALSE if none exists
	 */
	public function findActive() {
		$query = $this->createQuery();
		$result = $query->setLimit(1)->execute();
		return $result->getFirst();
	}


This is all we need for moving on to something more visible: the blog posts.


Basic Post Controller
=====================

Now let us add some more code to *.../Classes/Controller/PostController.php*::

	...

	class PostController extends \TYPO3\FLOW3\MVC\Controller\ActionController {

		/**
		 * @var \TYPO3\Blog\Domain\Repository\BlogRepository
		 * @FLOW3\Inject
		 */
		protected $blogRepository;

		/**
		 * Index action
		 *
		 * @return string HTML code
		 */
		public function indexAction() {
			$blog = $this->blogRepository->findActive();
			$output = '
				<h1>Posts of "' . $blog->getTitle() . '"</h1>
				<ol>';

			foreach ($blog->getPosts() as $post) {
				$output .= '<li>' . $post->getTitle() . '</li>';
			}

			$output .= '</ol>';

			return $output;
		}

	...

The ``indexAction`` retrieves the active blog from the ``BlogRepository`` and
outputs the blog's title and post titles [#]_. A quick look
at http://dev.tutorial.local/typo3.blog/post [#]_ confirms that the
``SetupController`` has indeed created the blog and post:

Create Action
=============

In the ``SetupController`` we have seen how a new blog and a post can be
created and filled with some hardcoded values. At least the posts should,
however, be filled with values provided by the blog author, so we need to pass
the new post as an argument to a ``createAction`` in the ``PostController``::

	// ...

	/**
	 * Creates a new post
	 *
	 * @param \TYPO3\Blog\Domain\Model\Post $newPost
	 * @return void
	 */
	public function createAction(\TYPO3\Blog\Domain\Model\Post $newPost) {
		$blog = $this->blogRepository->findActive();
		$blog->addPost($newPost);
		$this->postRepository->add($newPost);
		$this->addFlashMessage('Created a new post.');
		$this->redirect('index');
	}


The ``createAction`` expects a parameter ``$post`` which is the ``Post`` object
to be persisted. The code is quite straight-forward: add the post to the blog,
add a message to some flash message stack and redirect to the index action.
Try calling the ``createAction`` now by accessing
http://dev.tutorial.local/typo3.blog/post/create:

.. image:: /Images/GettingStarted/CreateActionWithoutArgument.png

FLOW3 analyzed the new method signature and automatically registered ``$post``
as a required argument for ``createAction``. Because no such argument was
passed to the action, the controller exits with an error.

So, how do you create a new post? You need to create some HTML form which
allows you to enter the post details and then submits the information to the
``createAction``. But you don't want the controller rendering such a
form – this is clearly a task for the view!

.. [#]	Remember, *prototype* is the default object scope and because the
		``BlogRepository`` does contain a ``Scope`` annotation, it has the
		singleton scope instead.
.. [#]	Don't worry, the action won't stay like this – of course later we'll
		move all HTML rendering code to a dedicated view.
.. [#]	The *typo3.blog* stands for the package *TYPO3.Blog* and *post* specifies the
